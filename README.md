Our database is minimalistic, focusing on the essentials. At its core, we only need to manage **users** and their **comments**, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.

To enhance functionality, weâ€™ve integrated **nodemon** for live server hosting. This setup allows us to run the server locally while maintaining the flexibility to host remotely on platforms like AWS, Azure, or others if needed.
